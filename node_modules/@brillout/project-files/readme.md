This package is mainly about:
 - Automatically find the root directory of a user's Node.js project.
 - Search for files amongst all user's project files (while ignoring `.gitignore` files, e.g. `node_modules/`).

This package is for library authors and not for end users.

There is no documentation (yet).

If you need a complete documentation then open a GitHub issue and I will write a complete documentation.

If you need to know something about this package, then open a GitHub issue and I will provide you with the information you need.
